There are "rooms" which are virtual areas dedicated to particular cyber security topics.

The rooms we have developed and think worth completing are as follows:

1. [How to use Burp Suite](https://tryhackme.com/room/learnburp)
2. [Learning Reverse Engineering](https://tryhackme.com/room/reverseengineering)
3. [Cracking Hashes Challenges](https://tryhackme.com/room/crackthehash)
4. [Basic Penetration Testing](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentesting)

We have an official [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/tryhackme) room too
 which goes through tutorials on using TryHackMe.

We are still in the process of creating rooms and tasks. If there are good rooms
developed by other users on the site, we will reference them here too!
