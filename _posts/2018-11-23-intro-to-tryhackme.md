TryHackMe is an online platform that takes the pain out of teaching cybersecurity
by allowing teachers to easily managetheir material and setup using the cloud.
We make it a comfortable experience for students to learn by designing prebuilt
courses, avoiding the hassle of setting everything. Perfect for CTFs, Workshops,
Assessments or Training.

We also love to do anything Cyber Security related. From independent research to
making our own courses on the [main site](https://tryhackme.com/).

## Update:

Our initial launch got **62** sign ups, which is awesome! However, we keep getting the
question "what are rooms" and "how do I connect to network". Thats the reason we have
so many sign ups and so little activity within our "rooms". We created a
[Getting Started](https://tryhackme.com/getting-started) page that explains what
 we do and how the site works.

We also have create an [official TryHackMe room](https://tryhackme.com/room/tryhackme)
that shows you how to connect to our network.

Very soon we will be releasing videos showing you how to use the site. Although, if you
have used OpenVPN before it shouldn't be much trouble. Just give the
[Getting Started](https://tryhackme.com/getting-started) guide a read.
