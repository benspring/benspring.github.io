TryHackMe takes the pain out of learning and teaching Cybersecurity. Our platform makes it a comfortable experience to learn by designing prebuilt courses which include virtual machines (VM) hosted in the cloud ready to be deployed. This avoids the hassle of downloading and configuring VM's. Our platform is perfect for CTFs, Workshops, Assessments or Training.

We also love to do anything Cyber Security related. From independent research to
making our own courses on the [main site](https://tryhackme.com/).

## Update 2:

Some of you may have had trouble if you are on a Windows operating system. We have
now fixed the OpenVPN and loading bugs. Everything should work for Windows and Linux
systems. Sorry for the trouble.

On the otherhand, we released a new room that contains using popular tools such as nmap,
 sqlmap, dirbuster and port knocking. As always, there is no downloading. Deploy it directly
 from the cloud. Can you root this machine? [LordOfTheRoot](https://tryhackme.com/room/lordoftheroot)


## Update:

Our initial launch got **62** sign ups, which is awesome! However, we keep getting the
question "what are rooms" and "how do I connect to network". Thats the reason we have
so many sign ups and so little activity within our "rooms". We created a
[Getting Started](https://tryhackme.com/getting-started) page that explains what
 we do and how the site works.

We also have create an [official TryHackMe room](https://tryhackme.com/room/tryhackme)
that shows you how to connect to our network.

Very soon we will be releasing videos showing you how to use the site. Although, if you
have used OpenVPN before it shouldn't be much trouble. Just give the
[Getting Started](https://tryhackme.com/getting-started) guide a read.
