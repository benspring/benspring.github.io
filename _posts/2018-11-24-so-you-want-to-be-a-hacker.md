Well, that term is absolutely ridiculous. The term "hacker" has become so losely used and is not something I associate
anyone with. You don't hear [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick)
reference himself as a hacker? A few words of the wise, nothing is unhackable ([*cough @ John McAfee*](https://www.cnet.com/news/john-mcafees-unhackable-crypto-wallet-allegedly-hacked-a-week-after-challenge/)).  In my opinion,
cyber security is broken up into many parts.

Break down of cyber security areas
- Web Application
- Infrastructure
- Internet Of Things (IoT)
- Application
- Forensic
- Cryptology

There are many many more areas, but these are the ones the majority of people tend
to focus on. Our public rooms will focus on these areas and over time the more rooms
you complete the more knowledge you will gain. The only way to truely become good at
pentration testing in any sense, is to practise loads, read a lot and understand the
concepts/process behind what you are testing/probing. The good news is, TryHackMe will
try its best to develop rooms and share our knowledge as much as possible.

As well as developing cyber security couses, we will be releasing other fun rooms. A
few we have in mind are
- Creating your own Crypto-Currency (doge coin)
- Capture the Flags & Competitions
- RFID Cloning

If you have any ideas for rooms we should create please let us know in the comments.
