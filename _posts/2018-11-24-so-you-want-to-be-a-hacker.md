Well, that term is absolutely awful. In my opinion, cyber security is broken up into
many parts. The term "hacker" has become so losely used and is not something I associate
anyone with. You don't hear [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick)
reference himself as a hacker? A few words of the wise, nothing is unhackable.

Break down of cyber security areas
- Web Application
- Infrastructure
- Internet Of Things (IoT)
- Application
- Forensic
- Cryptology

There are many many more areas, but these are the ones the majority of people tend
to focus on.
